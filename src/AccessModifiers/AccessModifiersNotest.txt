What are Access modifiers?
In Java, access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables.

Notes: First check at class level, method/variable level and then check package.

Types of Access modifiers?
1) private => whatever private is accessible only within same class
2) public
3) protected
4) default(no need to specify it)//whenever we do not provide any access modifier
                                    //it means we are using default access  modifier

Relationship
1) IS-A
2) HAS-A

IS-A relationship is achieved using Inheritance.
HAS-A relationship is based upon Usage.

When we have 2 classes which does not share any parent/child relationship, then we can create object of 1 class in
another class and using that object we can access methods/variables of that class.

Note: When we are using 1 public class in another package we must first import that class.
Note: We must know which access modifier is used for class/variables/methods

class => public and default
methods =>
variables =>

Nexon IS-A Car(Child class IS-A Parent)

Car HAS-A Engine.


class Car {
   applyBreak(){}
   psvm(){
     Engine engine = new Engine();
     engine.startEngine();
   }
}

class Nexon extends Car {

}

class Engine{
    startEngine(){}
}

Same package subclass       =>  IS-A
Same package non-subclass   =>  HAS-A
