What is Abstraction in Java?
=> It is a process in which we show what is essential and hide implementation details.
=> Hiding details and showing essential info.

Why we need Abstraction in Java?
=> Hide complexity of the system from User.

How can we achieve Abstraction in Java?
1) abstract class  (incomplete class)
2) interface


We use abstract keyword to create an abstract class
abstract is non access modifier in Java

We create an abstract class with abstract methods
then we extends this class by non-abstract class and
provide  implementation to the abstract methods.

abstraction tells us WHAT to do, but it let the child class decide HOW to do it

abstract methods
1) abstract keyword
2) no method body(no curly brackets)


Abstract class rules:

1) It's not mandatory to have abstract method in abstract class.

2) If we define any abstract method in a class, then that class must be an abstract class.

3) We can not create an object of abstract class.

4) If one abstract class extends another abstract class,
then it's not mandatory for that child class to provide method implementations of abstract methods of super class.

5) If concrete/non-abstract class extends  abstract class,
then its  mandatory for that child class to provide method implementations of abstract methods of super class.
