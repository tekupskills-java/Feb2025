to create an interface we use keyword interface.

we use interface to achieve 100% abstraction

by default methods in interface are abstract
variables in interface are always  public static final
we can not create an object of an interface

A) 1 class extends another class
B) 1 class can implements 1 or more interfaces
C) 1 interface can extends 1 or more another interfaces

If one abstract class implements one or more interfaces,
then it's not mandatory for that child class to provide method implementations of abstract methods of interface.

If concrete/non-abstract class implements one or more interfaces,
then its  mandatory for that child class to provide method implementations of abstract methods of interface.


class ClassName {

}

interface InterfaceName {

}
