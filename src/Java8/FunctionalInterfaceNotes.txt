What is functional interface in Java?
The interface which contains only 1 abstract method is called as Functional interface.

SAM => Single Abstract Method interface

1 interface AAA which contains 2 abstract methods

let's add 1 more method in interface AAA

100 classes which implements AAA

I want to add new method in interface AAA but without having any impact on 100 implementation classes


1) default method
2) static method

Lambda expression

backward compatibility  =>

mobile OS updates => 13 => 14  changelog

existing features they should keep working as they were working before
you will few new features
