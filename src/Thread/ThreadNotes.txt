what is Thread in Java?
=> small set of instructions given to CPU
=> the smallest independent path of execution within a process.


How to create Thread in Java?
1) extends Thread class
2) implements Runnable interface

Why we got 2 ways for creating a Thread in Java?
or difference between 2 ways?

When a class extends Thread class it becomes instanceof Thread class directly.

When class implements a Runnable interface it becomes instanceof Runnable and we need to pass that instance/obj to
Thread class constructor then we get a Thread.

Thread life cycle

Gpay  => 1 Cr 10 AM
         0 10 AM

What is synchronization and why should we use it?
We allow only 1 thread to access the code and other Threads will wait
until that Thread completes the execution for the same resource.

Railway station  => 1 ticket counter  10 persons Person1  Person2 Person10
                 => 10 counter   10 persons

synchronize

multi threading => data issue

read ops  => select * from Employee;
write ops => insert into

 int add(int a, int b){

    return a + b;
 }

 10,20  => 30   40 -10
