What is Polymorphism?
Using 1 thing in many forms.


Why we need Polymorphism?



How do we achieve Polymorphism?
A) Compile time or static binding or Method Overloading
B) Runtime or dynamic binding or Method Overriding


Method Overloading                          vs    Method Overriding
Same class                                  vs    Parent Child class
parameter list must be different            vs    Parameter list must be same
