What is Method overloading?
When we have same method name but different parameters in the same class.


Why should we use it?

Objects behave differently?

What is method signature?


    public void test(int a, String s){

    }

Why method overloading is also called as Compile-time polymorphism?


1) Same Method Name: Methods must have the same name.
2) Different Parameter Lists: Methods must have different parameter lists, differing in:
        Number of parameters: Different quantities of parameters.
        Types of parameters: Parameters of varying data types.
        Order of parameters: Sequence of data types of parameters differing.
3) Occurs within the same class: Method overloading must occur within the same class.

4) Return Type: The return type can be the same or different. Changing only the return type is not sufficient for overloading.
5) Access Modifiers: Methods can have different access modifiers (e.g., public, private, protected).
