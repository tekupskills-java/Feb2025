What is static in Java?
non access modifier and keyword
whatever static it belongs to the whole class and not to any specific object.
only 1 copy of static is available to the all objects of that class.

Object is not required to access static variables.
Whatever which is static will get loaded into memory when we are loading the class(.class file).

Why we need static in Java?
for better memory management we use static.

Why we have main() method as static method?

Types of Variables
1) Instance    => Variable declared at class level
2) Static
3) Local    => if we declare a variable inside method is called as Local variable.


Constructor provides default values to Instance variables.
JVM provides default values to static variables.
Local variables does not get any default value, you must assign some value before you use it.


Each Object will get a separate copy of instance variables.

All objects of a class share same copy of static variable.
