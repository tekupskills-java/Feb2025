What is String class in Java?
String is nothing but sequence of chars.


In how many different ways we can create String class Objects?
1) Using new keyword
2) Using String literals

Mutable version of String class => StringBuilder and StringBuffer

Why String class is considered as most commonly used class in Java?


What is Immutability?
Once we create an Object of a String class, we can not modify the object.
If you try to modify that Object, we will get a new Object and original Object will remain as it is.


What is Mutable?
We can modify an existing Object.


Heap   => String Constant Pool



Immutability vs Final?


class Aadhar {

    String name;
    String address;
    long aadharNumber;
    int age;
    long mobileNumber;

}


Aadhar Akash = new Aadhar();

String is Immutable class => Java
Can we create a custom Immutable class in Java?
Yes, we can create.

How to create a Custom Immutable class in Java?



Immutable => Custom Immutable class

1) Make the class final
2) Make fields final and private
3) Only provide getter methods
4)


 public StringBuilder append(String str) {
         super.append(str);
         return this;
     }

 synchronized StringBuffer append(AbstractStringBuilder asb) {
         toStringCache = null;
         super.append(asb);
         return this;
 }



 Threading   =>   Executor  1000 threads  => starving
 Array       =>   Collection



 StringBuilder  => Data inconsistency

 1000000   => SQL to fetch all records    0.5 m seconds

 Executor  => SQL  StringBuffer  => data consistent
